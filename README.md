# prework-study-guide

## Description


- The purpose of this project is to help prepare for the first day of the bootcamp by familiarizing oneself with the foundational concepts
- This study guide was created as a reference for future projects and coursework
- In the event that I find I'm stuck a project in the future, I can always refer back to the foundational notes and the code I've already written that does work
- This prework-study-guide tuaght me more about the importance of version control. In previous classes related to web development I didn't quite grasp the git flow. However, now I have a better understanding of how git works and I have firsthand experience with bug fixes.
